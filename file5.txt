# Solana Backend

This project demonstrates a basic Solana backend system using Rust.

## Setup

1. Install Rust and Solana CLI.
2. Run `cargo build-bpf` to build the program.
3. Deploy the program to the Solana blockchain.

## Usage

1. Call the program to increment the counter.
2. Verify the counter value.

Note: This is a simplified example and should not be used in production without proper testing and security audits.
